Neuralink will add additional layers to human identity

Theres the idea that bit by bit you can replace your brain with a digital substrate and you will be converted to digital form without loss of identity because it's a slow process and you will have continuity of identity.
Something about this doesn't feel right to me.
What doesnt feel right is that future you is now dead.  At least the future you that would have been had you stayed in your biological body.
I think the human body significantly shapes our identity on many levels.  Fundamentally though, our brain works in a specific way, our nurons grow and change as we experience the world, and unless the digital substrate works in the same way, then the structures that hold our thought change.  I would be worried that the new digital substrate would constrain my growth, or my views, or outlook on like.

I want continuity of identity, but I also want the ability for my identity to grow and adapt to my new experiences.
I trust the way biology adapts my brain to my experiences.
I don't think I would trust a digital substitute because it would respond in an idempotent fashion.  For the same inputs, the same outputs would be generated.  I have a hunch that this is true for biology.  Biology makes mistakes, biology is fluid, in general it will give you the same output, but not always.  Maybe one nuron pathway will fire, maybe another.  I like the idea of this randomness contributing to my experiences and to my identity.  In a digital form, this randomness could only be provided random number generators, and perlion noise generators.  I'm sure we could get close to mimmicing biological randomness, but in my heart, it still feels fake.


Human vs digital.  environmental and biological signals like hunger, tastiness, tiredness, cold, sickness, hugs, euphoria.
Maybe we can replicate these sensations digitally, but in my heart, it still feels fake.

How do I know that I have free will vs some mechanical externally imposed self will dictated by pre-designed algorithms?
Biology isn't designed in advance.  It evolves and changes.  The algorithms from biology are fluid.  My biological algorithms are different from your biological algorithms.  Likewise, future me's biological algorithms will be different from current me.
