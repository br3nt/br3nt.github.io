In this game, you improve a city, and over time, the inhabitants grow as well as the military powers.

The idea for the military originates from the little planets in Solar 2.

The city will automatically spawn military units which will wander around the city.

If enemies approach, the units will attack the enemies automatically.

You can also create leader units, which you can move and position on the board.  Military units will automatically follow leaders.

To take over another city, move a leader to an enemy city.

You can set min/max military units to stay with cities and leaders.

The number of leaders a city can have is limited, but can be grown through development.

A city can be built up.
- Granary maintains food supply during bad weather/winter/etc
- City walls improve defence
- Library, school, university, labs, etc increases skill - can be focused, eg science, arts, humanities, etc


The game starts with many city states and surrounding villages already on the board.  Eventually, these city states and villages can be taken over via various means to form your empire.  You can still settle new cities if you wish.

Resources can be sent to support other cities.


## Tile improvements
Tile improvements dont necessarily destroy natural formations or tile abilities



### Radar
Radar allows you to see units for a certain distance (eg x).  Without radar you can only see where your units are.
Perhaps listening posts are the older equivalent?

### Power lines
Electrical devices must be powered

### Trench warfare
trenches can connect between tiles
Trenches need to be supplied with resources.  The supply line can be disrupted.  Which means ammo can run out and military can starve
The fire power of the entrenched units is spread out (evenly?) over the trench system
Brings a tower defence type feel to it
Perhaps have a trench view where you can add special trench features like turrets etc.

Either:
* only certain units can be entrenched, eg troops
* or all unit can be entrenched, but their fire power is spread out over the trench system.
  Eg 1 artilary over 3 tiles means fire power is 1/3 for each shot, but also 3 shots can be fired from anywhere in the trench system with the same range

# Speacial concepts
## Speed of communication

News arrives with travellers and traders from other lands at the speed they travel.  If noone travels to and arives from an area then you hear no news.



## Private enterprise
- can generate raw resources automatically, can produce items automatically.  But for a tradeoff.  We do get tax revenue though.


## States/Provinces
- Early game play creates states or provinces.  Early game cities expand their control and may encompase smaller surrounding villages
- As early game cities are merged into a larger civ, the area of control becomes a state.
- states can be taxed independently and perhaps have other benefits
- states can also be disolved (perhaps some sort of trade-off)
