title: Hexagonal Grids
---

This pen is my attempt at learning how to build hex grids from the [Hexagonal Grids](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) tutorial by [Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com).

The example is using the [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/).

The hex grid can be oriented such that the hex points or edges face upwards.  This is currently done in code.

The grid tracks mouse movements so that the hex currently under the mouse is highlighted.
Hexes are also selectable.
