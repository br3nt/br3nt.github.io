This is my attempt to follow along with [Coding Challenge #46.1: Asteroids with p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hacZU523FyM) by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw).

The example is using the [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/).

Just a fun little game!
